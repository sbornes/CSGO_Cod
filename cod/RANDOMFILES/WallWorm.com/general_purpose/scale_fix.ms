Fix Negative Scale on Painted Objects painted with the Object Paint tool in Graphite

The problem is that all Objects painted with the Object Paint Tool have a scale of [-1,-1,-1] by default.
This means that they are not actually representative of the original object.
The scale spinners do not let you go below 0... so trying to invesre the default 100 scale to -100 also does
not work.

That is why I made this script. You can fix the objects up to a point. They will not look exactly as painted,
but they will at least now look as if they would have looked had the scale not preset to [-1,-1,-1].
